# hello-world
My first repository with Atlanta Open Source Meetup

Hello.  I am attending my first meeting up today with Atlanta Open Source in hopes to learn a little more about GitHub for personal and professional reasons :-)  On the professional side I'm a Sr. QA Analyst at Wolters Kluwer and we GitHub.  On the personal side, Iâ€™m the owner of a Dog Boarding, Grooming and Training company called Show My Dog, LLC.  I have a company website on WordPress.  Dog Training is my real passion.  I love showing my Miniature Schnauzer Cooper in competition obedience and agility AKC trials.
